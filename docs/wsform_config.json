        "parameters": "<p><strong>use-api-user-only<\/strong> [default = \"yes\"][<span style=\"color: rgb(192, 80, 77);\">experimental<\/span>]<br>The config setting<strong> user-api-user-only<\/strong> is a new feature as off 0.8.0.5.0. Default is set to yes (old WSForm behaviour)\r\n * If set to \"no\", WSForm will create\/edit\/upload under the current logged in user, instead of the WSForm user\r\n *. Even if set to no (leaving it empty also means yes),\r\n * WSForm still needs an API user for other tasks, so make sure you add a WSForm user<\/p><p><strong>api-username<\/strong><\/p><p>API username or BOT<\/p><p><strong>api-password<\/strong><br>API password or BOT password<\/p><p><strong>api-url-overrrule<\/strong><br>WSForm will try to figure out where the api.php from MediaWiki can be found. If this doesn't work correctly you can enter the the API url here manually<\/p><p><strong>api-cookie-path<\/strong> [default = '\/tmp\/CURLCOOKIE']<br>When sending API requests we need to set a cookie. If for some reason this does not work for you, try removing '\/tmp\/' and just leave \"CURLCOOKIE\"<\/p><p><strong>wgAbsoluteWikiPath<\/strong><br>is used when in a farm. Needs to be the path to the current wiki.<br>There it will look for WSFormSettings.php to read the username and password for that wiki user.<\/p><p>Example wgAbsoluteWikiPath :&nbsp; $IP . '\/wikis\/' . $serverName<\/p><p><strong>use-smtp<\/strong><br><\/p><p>By default use-smtp is set to no, meaning it will use PHP Mail() functions. When set to yes, make sure you fill in all the other fields needed for SMTP. If you are in a Farm, please use WSFormSettings.php to setup SMTP on a farm.<br>All other SMTP fields are :<\/p><ul><li>smtp-host<\/li><li>smtp-authentication<\/li><li>smtp-username<\/li><li>smtp-password<\/li><li>smtp-secure<\/li><li>smtp-port<\/li><\/ul><p><strong>wgScript<\/strong><br>defaults to '\/index.php' and is used for following a new created page. If your main wiki instalment is somewhere else, then set it here.<\/p><p><strong>rc_site_key<\/strong> and<strong> rc_secret_key<\/strong> <br>If you want to use the Google Recaptcha, set rc_site_key and rc_secret_key. You receive this from Google when you sign-up<\/p><p><strong>sec <\/strong>(true or false - default : false (for compatibility)<br>If sec is set to true, security for WSForm is set to heavy.
